# kaggle_titanic

very basic random forest with feature extraction from name, 74%

to improve could extract features form cabin num,
experiment with removing name features as redundant from sex features,
use missing data as a feature in itself (survivors may be more likely to have data known abiout them),
balance inputs to be closert to 5050,
experiment with gradient boosted trees
